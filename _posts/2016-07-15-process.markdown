We have many advocates for accessibility throughout the company, but at the time of our gathering, we didnâ€™t have a company-wide structure in place to implement standards across the board.

Two months later, in July, we picked up the project again at our annual hack week, <a href="http://product.voxmedia.com/vax">Vax</a>. We sketched, wireframed, and built this checklist as a tool for teams to use. Guidelines are listed by role because everyone is responsible for accessibility on a team.
